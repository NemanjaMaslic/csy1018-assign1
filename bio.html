        Hello, my name is Nemanja Maslic. I was born on the 14th of October, 1997.
        I was born in Serbia, and moved away to Norway in 1998, and then moved
        to England in 1999. I lived in London for a few years and then moved to a
        small town called Corby. I live with my parents and 2 sisters. I currently
        study at the University of Northampton, and I'm doing a degree in
        Business Computing Systems. This involves me looking at things like
        Digital Footprint, Web Development, Programming, Problem Solving,
        Databases, Software Engineering and Computer Systems.

        I am currently designing my own website which will have my CV on it and
        information about me which I will be using as an employability tool.
        This will show employers that I can use HTML coding, and that I'm able
        to create a website. This is putting my skills to the test.
