    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>In the modern day world, everything we do is based on computing and
        technology, and I would like to have a look at that in more detail and
        be able to understand computing on a larger scale.</h3>

        Hello, my name is Nemanja Maslic. I was born on the 14th of October, 1997.
        I was born in Serbia, and moved away to Norway in 1998, and then moved
        to England in 1999. I lived in London for a few years and then moved to a
        small town called Corby. I live with my parents and 2 sisters. I currently
        study at the University of Northampton, and I'm doing a degree in
        Business Computing Systems. This involves me looking at things like
        Digital Footprint, Web Development, Programming, Problem Solving,
        Databases, Software Engineering and Computer Systems.

        I am currently designing my own website which will have my CV on it and
        information about me which I will be using as an employability tool.
        This will show employers that I can use HTML coding, and that I'm able
        to create a website. This is putting my skills to the test.
        As a student I am honing my coding skills and putting together
        the knowledge which I have learnt so far in Web Development.

        I have always found working on a computer a thing which I enjoyed.
        So I decided to put that to use by doing IT at A Level, this I truly
        believe was a great choice as I was always using a computer; in and
        out of school. Doing IT for a few years really helped to create a
        sense of professionalism towards my work as it always had to be at a
        good standard when it was being marked. So when I do complete a piece
        of work I generally take pride in what I have composed myself.
