# csy1018-assign1
The first page which I completed was the CV page.
I went through it to make sure there was indents on there so that the code could be read correctly
I spoke to a fellow student called Beth about the assignment. In the drop in session I spoke to a guy called
Miguel about how to create the nav-bar. (25/11/2016)
I also collaborated with Hannah to see how much she'd completed, and asked her what she did about the contact form.
It took me roughly 2-3 hours to complete, it was on and off as I needed to think about the information
which I had to put on there.
I then started working on my Index/Homepage. I first put in an image of myself, and then worked around
adding some basic information. So far I've done about an hours work on my Index.
I've now started working on my About Me page (02/12/2016) and this I'm doing on my own, but small faults which
I'm coming across I'm going to ask for help.
I also found the code for a contact form online as I wouldn't know how to create that myself. (02/12/2016)
I've referenced it in my work, but I'll reference it here. http://www.123contactform.com/html-contact-form/
I selected a font from google fonts as well called Aref Ruqaa. (06/12/2016)

Centering the images on my pages I used the following website to help me.(06/12/2016)
