# csy1018-assign1
The first page which I completed was the CV page.
I went through it to make sure there was indents on there so that the code could be read correctly
I spoke to a fellow student called Beth about the assignment. In the drop in session I spoke to a guy called
Miguel about how to create the nav-bar. (25/11/2016)
The nav-bar system I completed using the <a> and created a class called nav-bar and each one is linked to
another page. I then added a hover bit on the nav bar so that when the mouse went over it, it would change colour.
I asked my friend Rich how he did it.
I also collaborated with Hannah to see how much she'd completed, and asked her what she did about the contact form.
It took me roughly 4 hours to complete the CV page, it was on and off as I needed to think about the information
which I had to put on there as well as what code or css I could potentially use in it.
I then started working on my Index/Homepage. I first put in an image of myself, I centered it,
and then worked around adding some basic information. So far I've done about 2 hours of work on my Index.
I've now started working on my About Me page (02/12/2016) and this I'm doing on my own, but small faults which
I'm coming across I'm going to ask for help. On the About Me page, I have information separated by images on there,
the information and images are all centered too. I've worked about 3 hours on this page.
I also found the code for a contact form online as I wouldn't know how to create that myself. (02/12/2016)
When I found
the correct code which I wanted I had to input the correct colours for the font and background so the code had it.
I've referenced it in my work, but I'll reference it here. http://www.123contactform.com/html-contact-form/
On the contact page I spent about half an hour to an hour as it was literally just looking for the correct code
which I could use for the contact form and then playing around with the way I wanted it laid out.
I selected a font from google fonts as well called Aref Ruqaa. (06/12/2016)

Centering the images on my pages I used the following website to help me.(06/12/2016)

I wanted to get rid of the bullet points in the CV page so I looked it up.(06/12/2016)

I added more information to the About Me page today. (06/12/2016)
When it came to the other bits like centering, looking for the right font and stuff, I spent a good 1-2 hours
just researching the relevant css which I would need to implement.
I've been working through the pages and just adding little bits here and there, I added a footer to the pages
with a copyright symbol and my name. (07/12/2016)
To make my footer stick to the bottom of the page on all of the pages, I had a look on a website to see how to
make the footer expand to the sides so there was no padding or margin around it.

So far all together, I have about 11 hours of work.
