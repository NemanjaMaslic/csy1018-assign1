# csy1018-assign1
The first page which I completed was the CV page.
I went through it to make sure there was intends on there so that the code could be read correctly
I spoke to a fellow student called Beth about the assignment. In the drop in session I spoke to a guy called
Miguel about how to create the nav-bar.
It took me roughly 2-3 hours to complete, it was on and off as I needed to think about the information
which I had to put on there.
I then started working on my Index/Homepage. I first put in an image of myself, and then worked around
adding some basic information.
