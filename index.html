      So this is my webpage that I have created. On here you will find my CV, a bit
      about myself, and a way to contact me. You can contact me through email or
      by telephone. I am currently a university student doing a business computing
      course, and part of the course involves me creating a website using HTML
      and CSS.

      In the following few years, I'm hoping to develop my skills in website coding,
      as it will be a crucial skill which some exployers will be looking for. Developing
      my own website will help me with that as I'm a newbie to the whole Web Development
      thing, but with work and 110% effort I believe it's possible to improve my skills
      greatly. With the help of Code Academy and constantly using the software it'll
      come with ease. I'll be constantly working on the css and the HTML.
