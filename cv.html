      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <p>
        For professional work experience, last summer, I worked with a company
        that required the making of a website for them. The Company which I
        worked for was called Claybrook Zoo, and they needed a website to
        attract more people to their zoo, so I created a website which allowed
        people to book tickets on, view the gallery of the animals and see what
        events were going on at what time.
